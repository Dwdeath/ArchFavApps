# Eddie_Archlinux_Customized
this is a script to easily update my private Archlinux - work in progress

how to use:

just grab the install.sh and activate it using:
```
sh ./install.sh --noconfirm
```
and enter what is asks.

After that it'll (in theory) just install everything automatically. 
it's gonna take quite a while, mostly because of the firedragon web browser. 

enjoy!

DISCLAIMER: this is meant for my personal use only!
I will not accept changes to the code, so if your'e interested just copy it!
thamk you.
