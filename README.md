# Eddie_Archlinux_Customized
this is a script to easily update my private Archlinux - work in progress

how to use:

as privilaged user in any ArchLinux enter the command:

```
sudo mkdir ~/Desktop/tempgit && cd ~/Desktop/tempgit/
git clone https://github.com/Dwdeath/Eddie_Archlinux_Customized.git
cd Eddie_Archlinux_Customized
sh ./ArchLinux_Eddie_Installer.sh
```
and enter what is asks.

it's completely automated (in theory) and going to take a while to finish...

enjoy!
