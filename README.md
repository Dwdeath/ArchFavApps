a list of apps I use and an installer script for when I need to reinstall.

usage:
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://dwdeath.github.io/FavApps/install_v3.sh)
```
or
```sh
curl -s https://dwdeath.github.io/FavApps/
```
and run the bash code using copy+paste

alternatively you can preform 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dwdeath/FavApps
```
to get all of the scripts.
